# Chum Bukkit Repo | JAVA
All of the custom plugins for the ChumSMP are stored here

Currently plugins are going through a rewrite where they will be able to access **config.yml** files that way they wont have to be recompiled when they are used. I am also moving away from they typical default minecraft color codes and moving to Hexidecimal colors
